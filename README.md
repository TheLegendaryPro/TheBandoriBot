### How QuizGUI runs:
1. set_bot()
2. on_ready() -> initiate_message()
3. go to each guild and call musicgui() there
4. check channel name and call call_gui()
5. create MusicQuiz init(), then add it to main_dict, and call create_message()
6. call get_embed() to get the embed, then send the message, then react to it
7. then it just listens...
Where there is a new message being sent:
1. on_message() triggers
2. if in command_dict, call invoke()
3. else call process_message()
4. if need to check answer, check song name of all lang
5. then check band
6. get prefix and name, and update_log() the message
Where there is a new reaction being given:
1. call process_reaction() on it
2. call the function corresponding to the function
